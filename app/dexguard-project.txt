# If you encounter problems in your project, you can try to narrow down
# the issue by disabling some processing steps:
#
#-dontshrink
#-dontoptimize
#-dontobfuscate
-dontwarn

# You can also check if the problem can be solved by keeping additional
# code and/or resources:
#
#-keep class * { *; }
#-keepattributes *
#
#-keepresources */*
#-keepresourcefiles res/**
#-keepresourcefiles assets/**
#-keepresourcefiles lib/**
#-keepresourcexmlattributenames **

# These are really crude settings that you shouldn't use for building
# actual releases, but it's easier to start from a working configuration,
# which you can then refine.
